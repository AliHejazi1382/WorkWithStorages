You know working with storage is very important. you know that the system provides several options for you to save your app data:
- App specific-storage
- Shared Storage
- Preferences
- Databases

We want to talk about [app specific-storage](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/app-specific#java).

For more information see [Data and file storage overview](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage).
### Problem
Sometimes it becomes very difficult to work with and people get into trouble.

The app specific-storage has many option, such as write data into external storage or internal storage, read data from external storage or internal storage and ect.

Recently, you can also save your data in encrypted form by `androidx.security` library.
